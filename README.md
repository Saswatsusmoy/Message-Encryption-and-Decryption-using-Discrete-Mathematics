# Message-Encryption-and-Decryption-using-Discrete-Mathematics

## Abstract

This project focuses on the creation of a model for encrypting text using Python language with the help of Combinatorics and other topics of Discrete Mathematics. Various mathematical concepts like Matrices, Determinants, Permutations, Functions, Relations, and Modular Arithmetic have been utilized in this project. The project also includes the analysis and implementation of various cryptographic algorithms and ciphers, with some modifications to make them less vulnerable and more efficient for real-life applications

## Cryptographic Ciphers used

- Shift Cipher
- Hill Cipher
- Vignere Cipher
- Permutation Cipher
- Substitution Cipher
- Affine Cipher

## Installation and Usage

To use this cryptographic model, clone the repository to your local machine and follow the instructions provided in the documentation for setting up the environment and running the code.

git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
